# Telecom ERD

## Description of the Use Case
The telecommunications industry is one of the industries where it uses intensive data. It 
stores massive amounts of data from like its customers and subscribers, their calls, SMS, and 
data usage among others. Hence a proper and efficient data management system is needed in 
order to effectively manage these data and deliver better service and customer satisfaction.
In this project, we consider the Mobile Segment Plan of a Telecommunications company. 
We designed a database system containing key data entities under the Mobile Segment Plan
involving customer data, mobile plan, call activities and usage. We implemented this using 
Postgresql and pgAdmin as the tool of choice for development and implementation. We will also 
discuss the ER Model Diagram particularly the relationship among entities, the cardinality, 
connectivity, specialization hierarchies, and other entity relationships.
